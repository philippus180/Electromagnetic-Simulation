# Elektromagnetic-Simulation
Inspired by ThreeBlueOneBrown I want to create a Simulation, that visualises the electromagnetic fields caused by moving charges. To calculate the EM-fieds I need to implement some form of Maxwells Equations and solve them numerically by tiny changes in time.
In the simulation your cursor should represent a charged particle, that you can move by moving the mouse. I imagine it to be very cool to see the influences of the movement on the field and especially the resulting EM-waves.

I will use python to calculate the physics. To visualize the fields I choose pygame to begin with, because I have some experience with it. Maybe later I look for a different graphics environment (maybe even matplotlib?).

In the last few weeks, I thougt a lot about this idea and I try to record as much of my thoughts in the development process as possible.
